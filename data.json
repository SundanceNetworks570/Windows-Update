    "description": "Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions below 1.3, Mermaid (which is used to render diagrams) allows embedding images which then get rendered by Cursor in the chat box. An attacker can use this to exfiltrate sensitive information to a third-party attacker controlled server through an image fetch after successfully performing a prompt injection. A malicious model (or hallucination/backdoor) might also trigger this exploit at will. This issue requires prompt injection from malicious data (web, image upload, source code) to be exploited. In that case, it can send sensitive information to an attacker-controlled external server. GitHub created this CVE on their behalf. The documented Visual Studio updates incorporate updates in Mermaid which address this vulnerability.

Updated the \"Are there any further actions I need to take to be protected from this vulnerability?\" FAQ to state that starting with the October 2025 security updates, the fix will be enabled by default (DisableCapiOverrideForRSA set to 1) and the KSP will be used for RSA based certificates in the Smart Card Certificate Propagation service. If you discover applications relying on the old behavior, the DisableCapiOverrideForRSA registry key can be set back to 0 to switch back to auditing mode. The DisableCapiOverrideForRSA registry key will be removed in April 2026. See the FAQ section of this CVE for more information.",

    "description": "Microsoft is aware of [AMD-SB-3020 | CVE-2025-0033](http://https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-3020.html) disclosed by AMD on October 13, 2025. CVE-2025-0033 is a vulnerability in AMD EPYC processors using Secure Encrypted Virtualization – Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). It involves a race condition during Reverse Map Table (RMP) initialization that could allow a malicious or compromised hypervisor to modify RMP entries before they are locked, potentially impacting the integrity of SEV-SNP guest memory. This issue does not expose plaintext data or secrets and requires privileged control of the hypervisor to exploit. Across Azure Confidential Computing products, multiple security guardrails are in place to prevent host compromise, combining isolation, integrity verification and continuous monitoring. All host operations follow audited and approved management pathways, with administrative access strictly controlled, limited and logged. Together, these protections reduce the risk of host compromise or unauthorized memory manipulation, helping ensure that confidential workloads and customer VMs maintain their confidentiality and integrity on Azure hosts.",
